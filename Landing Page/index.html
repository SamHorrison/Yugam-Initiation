            <h2><b>Through the Years</b></h2>
            <p id="timeline-para"> Yugam - A Colossal Congregation of Youth
                Yugam brings together people for days of celebration and superlative experience. Yugam makes Kumaraguru a locus of scholastic
                learning and innovation for diverse individuals from all over South India.  The main driving force being the dedication, hard work,
                ardour and zeal of the students, Yugam is a fest crafted over a period of several months to bring out the best of Kumaraguru. Through
                the years, Yugam has made a huge impact and an indelible imprint in the hearts and lives of thousands of people. For the first time
                ever since its genesis, Yugam went online in 2021. Even though we were in the midst of a great pandemic, we found a way to give back
                to society what we take from it. The ‘Make a Child Smile’ campaign illuminated the lives of over 200+ children by providing them with
                basic amenities. ‘Eegai with Ikigai’ helped many children by enabling them to get one step closer to what they want to become.
                ‘Mission Aagaaram’ – a campaign to support small businesses around Coimbatore. We had several workshops and events which provided a
                platform for students from different parts of India. YUGAM ’22 is here again, a brand-new reawakening, a renascence, to carry forth the
                legacy of Kumaraguru.</p>
